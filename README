Renamming scanned answer scripts using roll numbers, extracting question-wise images, generating submission CSV and zip folder to upload to SAFE.


Step 1: Get Boundaries

	Script: GetBoundaries.py

	- Input: Path to any one answer sheet (PDF).

	- Select top-left and bottom-right points of the region (e.g., roll number box or Q&A area).

	- Output (on terminal): {"x": X, "y": Y, "w": W, "h": H}

		where (x, y) = top-left coordinates, and (w, h) = width & height.

	- Note these values — used in later steps.

Step 2: Extract Roll Numbers

	Script: ExtractRollNumberTROCR.py

	- Input: Folder containing all scanned (but not renamed yet) answer scripts.

	- Also Provide the x, y, w, h values from Step 1 (i.e., coordinates of roll number box).

	- The script renames PDFs using extracted roll numbers and saves them to a new folder (path shown in terminal).

	- Verify renamed files — check if roll numbers match correctly for all the answer scripts.

Step 3: Extract Question-Wise Images & CSV

	Script: GetImageAndCSV.py

	- Input: Folder of renamed PDFs (from Step 2).

		Also Enter:

		- Number of pages.

		- Number of questions per page.

		- Subquestion info.

		- Boundaries for each question (get via GetBoundaries.py — this time select question/answer boxes). Add small padding to the boundaries to include extra writing area.

	- The script generates one consolidated folder containing:

		Cropped images (each question, for every student).

		submission.csv for grading.

Step 4: Upload the zip (output folder of Step 3) to SAFE for grading.
